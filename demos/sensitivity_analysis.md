## Sensitivity analysis

The figures below show the variation of isentropic efficiency with the blade velocity ratio for different degrees of reaction and stator exit flow angles. An optimum blade velocity ratio can be identified in all cases, and this optimum increases as the degree of reaction increases. In the limit of a purely reaction-type turbine, the optimal blade velocity ratio tends to infinity, implying extremely high blade speeds that would challenge mechanical integrity. The total-to-static efficiency also increases with the stator exit flow angle, since larger exit angles reduce the fraction of kinetic energy remaining at the rotor outlet. In practice, however, large stator exit angles lead to highly skewed velocity triangles and strong flow deflections, which introduce additional frictional losses not captured in this ideal analysis. These effects would shift the optimal blade velocity ratio and reduce the achievable maximum efficiency.
